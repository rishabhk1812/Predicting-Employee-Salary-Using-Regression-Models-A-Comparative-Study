# Predicting-Employee-Salary-Using-Regression-Models-A-Comparative-Study
In this project, we performed Salary Prediction using Regression Analysis. Two models, Linear Regression and Random Forest, were analyzed. The Random Forest model was executed in R software. Upon comparison, Linear Regression outperformed Random Forest in predicting salary more accurately, showing better MSE.
